## Project description:

We plan to analyze the content of Reddit gilded text comments to discover commonalities among gilded content. The three main factors to be analyzed are upvotes/downvotes, length, and language. (We will not be considering image-only comments, and we will not be considering posts themselves.) We plan to take this data from a publicly available compilation of all Reddit comments before July 2015.

Using the results of our analysis, we will identify the criteria that may predict whether a comment will be gilded; we will create graphs that illustrate our findings. We will train and test our program using these criteria. 

We will then monitor rising threads in r/all in real time to attempt to identify comments that will be gilded.

## Project major components:

1. Gather and parse data in a .csv file.

2. Analyze correlation between gilding and upvotes/downvotes,  correlation between gilding and the length of the comment, and correlation between gilding and the language used in the comment. Analyze findings, weigh the above relations in magnitude of their impact to develop a clear trend for gilding. Produce graphs to visualize data.

3. With that information, train and test our program to identify gilded comments based on their up/downvotes, length, and language. 

4. Monitor a select number of threads to predict comments that will be gilded.

## Packages used:

NLTK, pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy
