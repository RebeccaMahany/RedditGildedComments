# RedditGildedComments



## Project description:

Analyze the content of Reddit gilded text comments to discover commonalities among gilded content. The three main factors to be analyzed are upvotes/downvotes, length, and language. (Will not be considering image-only comments, and will not be considering posts themselves.) This data comes from a publicly available compilation of all Reddit comments before July 2015.

Identify the criteria that may predict whether a comment will be gilded.
