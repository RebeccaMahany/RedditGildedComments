## Project description:

We plan to analyze the content of Reddit gilded text comments to discover commonalities among gilded content. The three main factors to be analyzed are upvotes/downvotes, length, and language. (We will not be considering image-only comments, and we will not be considering posts themselves.) We plan to take this data from a publicly available compilation of all Reddit comments before July 2015.

Using the results of our analysis, we will identify the criteria that may predict whether a comment will be gilded; we will create graphs that illustrate our findings.

## Project major components:

1. Gather and parse data in a .csv file.

2. Analyze correlation between gilding and upvotes/downvotes,  correlation between gilding and the length of the comment, and correlation between gilding and the language used in the comment. Analyze findings, weigh the above relations in magnitude of their impact to develop a clear trend for gilding. 

3. Produce graphs to visualize data.

## Packages used:

NLTK, pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy
